#ReadyReader

ReadyReader is a mobile reading platform intended for on-the-go readers who utilize their modile devices as their primary means of reading. 

Primary contributors are as follows:

- [Ben Brostoff](https://github.com/BenBrostoff)
- [Greg Knudsen](https://github.com/greg99799)
- [Brendan Susens-Jackson](https://github.com/bsusensjackson/)

This project was built on Ruby on the Rails and significantly utilized [Hammer.js](http://hammerjs.github.io) for responsive gesturing functionality. We attempted to use a Test Driven Development oriented approach throughout this project, and made use of [RSpec](http://rspec.info/), [Capybara](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara) and [SimpleCov](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov) to achieve this purpose.

We owe a great debt to our Dev Bootcamp instructor [Matt Bunday](http://zencephalon.com), without whom this project would not have been possible. Matt came up with the original idea for ReadyReader and trusted us to execute on his vision. 

We welcome pull requests, questions and comments.
